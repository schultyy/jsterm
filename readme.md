# jsterm

This provides basic Terminal operations in a terminal app written in Typescript. It uses Atom's electron to provide a basic graphical user interface.


## Development

```
$ npm install
```

You also need `tsd`:

```
$ npm install -g tsd
```

Also `grunt-cli` installed with `-g` switch:

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Run

```
$ npm start
```

This compiles all Typescript files and starts jsterm. 

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```
